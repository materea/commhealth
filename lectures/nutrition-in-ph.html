           <p>The BMR energy requirement of man is met by three classes of organic food stuff: carbohydrate, proteins and fats. </p>
           <p>The metabolism of carbohydrate supplies more than half of the energy required for the day e.g. a sedentary woman requires 2000 kcal/day. Her carbohydrate intake must be designed to contribute more than half of this requirement otherwise fat and proteins may be required to supply the deficiency. </p>
           <p>Energy expenditure maybe classified as follows:</p>
           <ul>
            <li>Basal metabolism: </li>
            <ul>
                <li>When a subject is at complete rest and no physical work is being carried out energy is required for the activity of the internal organ and to maintain body temperature. </li>
                <li>This is refers to as basal or resting metabolism and it is estimated by measuring the basal metabolism rate. </li>
                <li>It is fairly constant for a given individuals and it is influenced by such factors as age, sex, weight, environmental temperature, pressure, rate of growth, endocrine activity, sleep, state of nutrition, physiological state e.g. last trimester of pregnancy is increased by 15-25%, lactation can also increase it.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Specific Dynamic Action: </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Some food items usually generate heat when consumed. </li>
                <li>The effect of such food substances in raising the metabolic rate above the basal rate is referred to as specific dynamic action. It has been shown that metabolism might increase. </li>
                <li>The heat produced by the SDA of protein contributes to the maintenance of body temperature.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Muscular Activity: </li>
            <ul>
                <li>This is the most important variable under normal condition. It depends on the type of work individuals engage in. </li>
                <li>Sedentary woman requires about 2000kcalories while manual worker is 4500kcalories.</li>
            </ul>
           </ul>

          </figure>

          <p>If energy provision is not sufficient to meet the demand, the body tissue is called upon to supply body energy. In prolonged starvation, the adipose tissue is depleted and ketosis result. </p>
          <p>The body becomes emaciated and this can lead to marasmus. When a child is over fed with carbohydrate with little or no protein, the needed protein will be drawn from the blood and this result in reduction of Osmotic Pressure and consequently oedema. </p>
          <p>While fat can be synthesized from dietary carbohydrate, carbohydrate can be derived from amino acids in proteins. The protein required by the body is usually derived by dietary sources.</p>

               <h4><span class="special-text-4">Kwashiorkor</span></h4>
               <ul>
                <li>A clinical syndrome caused by a deficiency of protein. Occur when the intake of energy is inadequate. Diarrhoea and infection are often the predisposing causes. </li>
                <li>The infections may divert the meagre amino acids to the production of globulins and acute phase reactant proteins, instead of albumin and transport proteins.</li>
                <li>Protein catabolism and nitrogen losses are enhanced by viral and bacterial infections. Protein losses can amount to 2% of muscle protein per day.</li>
                <li>Kwashiorkor occurs among children between 6months to 3years with the 2nd year being the most vulnerable. It also coincides with the weaning period when the diet is low of energy and proteins.</li>

                    <li>Lack of growth, muscle waste</li>
                    <li>Retention of subcutaneous fat and psychomotor changes.</li>
                    <li>The patient is irritable; cry easily and have an expression of misery and sadness</li>
                    <li>Biochemically, there may be increased fatty infiltration of the liver leading to hepatomegaly.</li>
                    <li>Oedema could be caused by reduction in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate due to decrease plasma volume and decrease cardiac output as consequences of hypo-albuminemia, this result in sodium retention and production of rennin and aldosterone, which will increase reabsorption of Na and water leading to oedema.</li>
                    <li>Patients with severe energy deficiency are usually unable to maintain the supply of tissue and cell energy supply and a serious decompensation occurs causing hypo-glycemia, hypo-thermia and impaired circulatory and renal functions which results in coma and death.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4><span class="special-text-4">Marasmus</span></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is an extreme form of under-nutrition due to lack of calories and protein. </li>
                    <li>It is characterized by generalized muscle wasting, absence of sub-cutaneous fat which gives the skin and bone appearance. </li>
                    <li>The children have marked retardation in longitudinal growth and lack of physical wellbeing, abnormal behaviour and poor mental development. </li>
                    <li>The hair is sparse, thin and without normal shine. The cheeks are sunken by the disappearance of the Bichat fat packs giving it the appearance of a monkey or little old man‚Äôs face. </li>
                    <li>It develops slowly to allow for better adaptation to energy inadequacy. A decrease energy intake is followed by a decrease energy expenditure which account for shorter periods of play and physical activity in children</li>
                    <li>Consequently for longer rest periods and less physical work in adult. When the decrease in energy expenditure cannot compensate for inadequate intake, body fat is mobilized at a faster rate than lean body mass with a decrease in adiposity and weight loss. </li>
                    <li>Where dietary proteins are of poor quality, body proteins will not be synthesized and body protein losses arise from skeletal muscle breakdown. </li>
                    <li>Initially, some essential proteins are lost but this soon stabilizes until the non-essential tissue proteins are depleted, the loss of visceral proteins accelerates and death may occur.</li>
                    <li>Seventy-five percent of the free protein of the body from dietary and tissue proteins are utilized for protein synthesis. </li>
                    <li>The remainder are broken down for other metabolic purposes. When dietary intake is decreased, all these decrease too, there is then a shift of albumin from intravascular to the extravascular pool which lead to decrease in intravascular oncotic pressure and outflow of water into the extravascular space, this contribute to the development of oedema seen in kwashiorkor patient. </li>
                    <li>Underweight individuals are more likely to be ill and then recovery from illness is out to take longer time than with normal person. There is need for a gradual adjustment to normalcy since the introduction of a high calorie diet may be fatal to a severely malnourished marasmic patient. </li>
                    <li>Diarrhoea which is the primary cause of death for under 5 children in the less developed countries occurs much more frequently among the marasmic patient than among the well fed.</li>

               <ul>
                <li>If neither parent is obese, the risk of obesity may be less than 10% but if one of them is obese, the risk of fatness is 40% but if both parents, 80%.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Endomorphic (soft and roundish) have much fat storage capacity. </li>
                    <li>Mesomorphic (bony and muscular) are in between.</li>
                    <li>Ectomorphic (lean, fragile, thin, slender with long finger) have low fat storage capacity.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Genes can directly cause obesity in disorders such as Bardet-Biedl syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome</li>
                <li>Energy-thrifty genes- genes that helped our ancestors survive occasional famines: Now with abundance food, it program us to keep growing fat all year round</li>
               </ul>
               <h4><span class="special-text-4b">Physical Activity: </span></h4>
               <ul>
                <li>This constitutes a measure of an individual‚Äôs lifestyle. Modern technology has ways of reducing this eg use of automobile, television. </li>
                <li>These conveniences have turn the population to sedentary people where physical activity is not highly priced the genetic potential obesity has greater opportunity to be expressed.</li>
               </ul>
               <h4><span class="special-text-4b">Physiological factors: </span></h4>
               <ul>
                <li>The food intake regulation is located in the hypothalamus of the brain. </li>
                <li>A short term regulation of the glucose sensitive receptors found in the ventro-media nucleus of the hypothalamus when blood glucose is high, the lateral nucleus is shut off and activated again when glucose levels are low. </li>
                <li>The obese compulsive person seems 2 have lost this normal control mechanism. His appetite is controlled by external influences and find it difficult to stop eating. </li>
               </ul>
               <h4><span class="special-text-4b">Psychological Factor: </span></h4>
               <ul>
                <li>Many obese persons eat to derive certain type of satisfaction or to compensate for certain person deficiency.</li>
               </ul>
               <h4><span class="special-text-4b">Socio-cultural Influences: </span></h4>
               <ul>
                <li>There is a belief that is associated with heavy eating with a change in fortune with occupational success but this comes at an age when caloric expenditure is decreased because of the modern conveniences and less physical activity. In Nigeria, generally, urban dwellers are fatter than rural dwellers.</li>
               </ul>
               <h4><span class="special-text-4b">Dietary Factors:  </span></h4>
               <ul>
                <li>Over feeding in infancy may be a factor in the incidence of obesity later in life. Formular ‚Äì fed babies are usually fatter than breast fed babies. </li>
                <li>Infant who gain excessive weight during the first 6months of life have a greater likelihood of being obese later in childhood than infants who gain weight normally.</li>
               </ul>
               <h4><span class="special-text-4b">Environment: </span></h4>
               <ul>
                <li>The major contributing factor is the obesogenic environment ‚Äì urbanization, fatty foods become increasingly accessible and physical activity decreases</li>
               </ul>

               <h4><span class="special-text-4">Obesity in Childhood</span></h4>
               <ul>
                <li>Fat cells (Adipocyte) grow by increase in number and size. N obese adult, it is the number of weight increased and when they lose weight it is the cell size that decrease. </li>
                <li>Infant growth occurs by increase in number and size. Obesity which results from an increase in fat cell number is called Hyperplastic obesity but that of increase fat cell size is called Hypertophic obesity. </li>
                <li>Obesity is early multiplication of adipocyte appears to take place during the first 3 years of childhood and adolescent period.</li>
               </ul>

               <h4><span class="special-text-4">Prevention and treatment</span></h4>
               <p>The best and most effective treatment is prevention. Losing weight and keeping off the weight is extremely difficult especially for those who are 25% or more overweight. </p>
               <p>A gain of 2kg of above one‚Äôs ideal weight should be a signal to start curtailing energy intake. The modes of treatment vary from one individual to another. </p>
               <p>The doctor or nutritionist must first conduct investigation to show whether it is due to endocrine problem or it is accompanied by diabetes or other health problem. </p>
               <p>These factors are;</p>

                <li>Exercise and drugs</li>
                <li>Diet and Dietary advice</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each patient should receive specific guideline</li>
                    <li>They must eat breakfast</li>
                    <li>Avoid late night eating</li>
                    <li>Increase the amount of water, fruit and vegetable intake because these will lower the total amount of food energy and saturated fat consumed. Fish or chicken should be substituted for beef and decreased amount of refined sugar and snacks. There is a liquid formula diet which can lead to a loss of weight within 2-4 weeks but it is not sustainable.</li>
                    <li>Some proposed total fast especially for Type II obese but here both fat and lean body mass which may not be easy to regain are lost. In general, a recommended pattern should permit a gradual loss of weight of not more than 0.9kg/week. For a woman, the diet should provide 1000-1500kcalories. For a man, 1500-2000kcalories which supply the basal metabolism per day.</li>

                <li>Psychotherapy (Behaviour Modifications)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The belief is that eating habits are learned behavior, so the focus is to change eating habit especially emotional and environmental factor that can lead to over eating.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Exercise</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If energy can be increased by implemental physical activity and energy intake is constant, weight will drop. However, it requires a significant amount of physical effort to expend a significant amount of energy.</li>

                <li>Nutritional anaemia depends on nutritional factors involve in their formation e.g. iron, folic acid and vitamin B12. Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common and it is characterized by hypochromia and microcytosis of the red blood cell. </li>
                <li>It results from inadequate diet, impaired absorption, blood loss or repeated pregnancy. </li>
                <li>The anaemia is prevalent in pregnancy because requirement is so large and greater than the dietary intake, therefore it must be supplemented</li>
                <li>In the adult, intestinal parasites like hookworm can cause anaemia, also accident, surgery, menstruation or blood donation are the ways of losing blood and consequently iron deficiency. Iron deficiency is also common among cereal eating population because it is poor in iron.</li>

                <li>This is found in cereal and vegetables, meat, vitamin c improve its absorption. Iron pot also contributes to its absorption. </li>
                <li>Iron excretion is limited since it depends on absorption, its being used and reserved. It is stored in the liver, spleen and bone marrow, used for erythropoiesis.</li>

           <p>Inadequate nutrition occurs from several biological, socio-cultural and economic aberrations among which are poverty, inadequate knowledge of nutrition and inadequate and unsafe water supply which may predispose individuals to diarrhoea diseases. </p>
           <p>The problems are presented in a triad of agent, host and environment.</p>

            <p>In a deficiency state, there is an insufficiency of nutrient at the cellular level to satisfy metabolic need. When there is an inadequate protein intake or an essential amino acid is missing, the body react as if all essential amino acid are deficient in the food and their utilization will not occur until all the essential amino acids are available at appropriately.</p>

            <h4><span class="special-text-4">Host</span></h4>
            <p>Within a given environment, some individuals are more susceptible than others to malnutrition. Host factors are age, sex, activity, growth, pregnancy, lactation and pathological state.</p>

                <li><span class="special-text">Poverty</span>: This limit the choice of food and it generates a circle, inadequate diet-malnutrition- illness-inability to work-poverty.</li>
                <li><span class="special-text">Lack of nutrition education</span>: Affect people of low income and educational level. Nutrition education programs help people learn about nutrient, food sources, better purchasing and better food preparation.</li>
                <li><span class="special-text">Cultural Factors</span>: Under the guides of religious taboos which prohibit eating of certain nutritious foods eg milk causes diarrhea, meat maybe held from children, mothers withhold solid food from children when they are ill.</li>
                <li><span class="special-text">Rural-Urban Migration</span>: Unable to accommodate the migrant in term of employment, housing, food and other services.</li>
                <li><span class="special-text">Inadequate Food Supply</span>: The food to population ratio is very critical. Nigeria, is not producing enough food distribution of food and this is also uneven worldwide. Government may not be able to finance irrigation program to have food all the year round. </li>
                <li>The income to purchase good food is another problem. Also, misplaced priority and poor budgeting can further aggravate this problem eg spending more money on arms, poor road network, expensive project, poor storage and distribution of foods, families having children by chance and not by choice.</li>
                <li>In Nigeria, polygamy further enhances its lack of knowledge of nutrition due to literacy and semi-literacy, insufficient food production, food storage and distribution.</li>

            <h4><span class="special-text-4">Causes of Malnutrition in Nigeria</span></h4>
            <p>Causes of malnutrition and food insecurity in Nigeria are multifaceted:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Poor infant and young child feeding practices</li>
                <li>Lack of access to healthcare water, and sanitation</li>
                <li>Armed conflict, particularly in the north</li>
                <li>Irregular rainfall</li>
                <li>High unemployment and poverty</li>
                <li> Chronic and seasonal food insecurity </li>
                <li>Volatile and rising food prices </li>
                <li>Cultural practices</li>
                <li>Ignorance, illiteracy, female education</li>

            <li>Malnourished children are susceptible to infection and the relationship is synergistic. </li>
            <li>Infection and diarrhoea diseases must be controlled through immunization, total maintenance of a health environment by the provision of adequate and safe water supply at the ease of all citizens. </li>
            <li>Poor food storage and distribution also contribute a problem of malnutrition in Nigeria e.g. Fish produced in Calabar barely get to Jos before they get spoilt. </li>
            <li>Fruits produced in villages rarely get to the city. Most foods produced are casual. </li>
            <li>The culture of buying and selling as opposed to production.</li>

           </ul>
           <p>In April 2016, Nigeria launched its ‚ÄúZero Hunger Initiative‚Äù to achieve the goal of eliminating undernutrition by 2025‚Äî ahead of the 2030 deadline of the UN‚Äôs SDGs</p>
           <p>Comprehensive legislation is in place for the implementation of the International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes. </p>
           <p>The addition of vitamin A to wheat flour, maize meal, vegetable oil, and sugar, as well as the addition of iron, zinc, folic acid, B vitamins, niacin, thiamine, and riboflavin to wheat, are mandated by law. </p>
           <p>Nigeria received Universal Salt Iodization certification in 2005 (Kuku-Shittu et al. 2016). </p>

            <li>Because of its multifactorial causation the solution too must be multifaceted and multisectoral.</li>
            <li>A permanent elimination of malnutrition cannot be accomplished without first overcoming poverty and mal-distribution of national wealth which makes health care available to all citizens. </li>
            <li>Government must create a political-economic system which will enable all or most of the citizen work and earn meaningful wages, thus providing decent living standards.</li>
