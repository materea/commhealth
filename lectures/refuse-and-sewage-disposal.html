            <p>The key to man‚Äôs health lies largely in his environment</p>
            <p>In fact, human activities and actions in his environment directly or indirectly impact on his supplies of water, foods and other conditions which invariably impact his health</p>
            <p>WHO estimated that 24% of the world‚Äôs burden of disease and about 1/3rd of the burden in children is due to preventable environmental factors e.g. unclean water and poor sanitation, and the two remain the most potent environmental causes of illness world-wide</p>
            <p>Environment implies all the external factors- living, non-living, material and non-material which surround man and can influence his health status</p>
            <p>It consists of physical (noise, climate, radiation, lightening, heat), biological (bacteria, viruses, insects, etc.) and social (beliefs, culture, religion, customs) factors</p>
            <p>Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity</p>
            <p>Environmental health is the branch of public health concerned with all aspects of the environment that may affect human health, encompassing the assessment and control of those environmental factors that can potentially affect health  </p>
            <p>Environmental Health can be defined as the science that is concerned with those aspects of human health, including quality of life, that are determined by physical, biological, social, and psychosocial factors in the environment</p>
            <p>It also refers to the theory and practice of assessing, correcting, controlling, and preventing those factors in the environment that can potentially affect adversely the health of present and future generations (WHO, 1993a)</p>
            <p>Environmental health addresses all human-health-related aspects of both the natural environment and the built environment.</p>

            <p>Disposal of waste is now the responsibility of Environmental Officers. However, health professionals need to have a basic knowledge of the subject matter since improper disposal of wastes constitute a health hazard. Again as health professionals, you could be called upon to give advice in some special situations</p>
                <p>Waste is any material or substances that do not have immediate economic value at that particular point in time and then becoming a nuisance to the disposer</p>
                <p>They are usually by-products of human activities that may be discarded or disposed of or reutilized in any other resourceful way</p>
                <p>Waste management is the practice of gradually reducing wastes with the ultimate aim of eliminating those that have the potential to cause harm to people and the environment.</p>
                <p>Solid waste, also known as refuse are substances produced in our daily activities at home, agricultural as well as industrial settings.</p>
                <p>Solid wastes generated in these settings include garbage, plastics, empty cans as well as biomedical (healthcare waste) and hazardous waste generated from industries </p>
                <p>Liquid waste on the other hand are collectively referred to as sewage</p>
                <p>Sewage include excreta of faeces and urine, effluent from bath, kitchen and laundry i.e. sullage as well as rain run-off and industrial wastewater  </p>
                <p>Solid wastes include</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>	Garbage (food wastes) </li>
                    <li>	Rubbish (paper, plastics, wood, metal, throw away containers, glass)</li>
                    <li>	Demolition products (bricks, masonry, pipes)</li>
                    <li>	Dead animals</li>
                    <li>	Sewage treatment residues (sludge and solids from the coarse screening of domestic sewage).</li>
                    <li>	Manure and other discarded materials. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The output of daily wastes depend upon the dietary habits, life styles, living standards and degree of urbanization or modernization </p>

            <p>What is the difference between sullage and sewage?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sewage or blackwater is waste water from a community, containing solid and liquid excreta, derived from houses, street and yard washings, factories and industries. It resembles dirty water with an unpleasant smell.</li>
                <li>The term sullage or greywater is applied to wastewater which does not contain human fecal matter, e.g. wastewater from kitchen, laundry and bathroom.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is important to adequately dispose sewage because of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>	To prevent soil and water pollution</li>
                <li>	Contamination of food</li>
                <li>	Propagation of flies</li>
                <li>	Diseases e.g. dysentery, diarrhea, cholera, hookworm, viral hepatitis</li>
                <li>	Proper disposal of human excreta is fundamental to environmental health</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><span class="special-text-4">Methods of Sewage Disposal</span></h4>
            <p>Methods of sewage disposal in unsewered areas include</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Service type latrines e.g. pail, bucket. Disposed by burying or composting</li>
                <li>	Non service type/sanitary latrine e.g. open defecation, pit latrine, water seal, septic tanks, aqua privy</li>
                <li>	Latrines for camps and temporary use e.g. shallow trench, deep trench latrine, borehole latrine, chemical closet</li>
            </ol>

                            <p>The conventional pit latrine consists of the pit, the floor and the superstructure. It should be at least 2.5 meters deep with floor made of reinforced concrete slab to ensure that it is strong and sited 6 meters from houses and 30 meters away and downhill from a water source. The pit must be provided with a tight lid. The pit latrine is ideal in rural areas and other communities where there is scarcity of water</p>
                            <p>There are many modifications of the pit latrine aimed at improving the sanitary characteristics of this method of disposal. Example is the ventilated improved pit (V.I.P.) latrine, the borehole latrine and the water seal pit latrine, etc. </p>
                            <p>A ventilated improved pit latrine has a vent pipe with a fly screen located outside the house. This helps to minimize fly and odor nuisance and makes the warm gas from the pit to move outside through the vent pipe</p>
