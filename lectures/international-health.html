              <li>The history of international health co-operation dates back to1851 when the first international sanitary conference was convened in Paris.</li>
              <li>The objective of the conference was to introduce some uniform laws to guide quarantine in all countries.</li>
              <li>This was not achieved and was to be followed subsequently by series of conference between 1851 and 1902 leading to international sanitary convention of 1903 to control certain epidemics that threatened the world, namely, plague, small pox, cholera and yellow fever. </li>
              <li>Various organizations were formed to deal with the practical application to the convention</li>
              <li>The international office of public Health created in 1907 in Paris to disseminate information on communicable diseases, as well as supervise international quarantine measure</li>
              <li>Health organization of the League of Nations set up 1921 in Geneva after the First World War (1914 ‚Äì 1918) to assist in ensuring peace in the world and ‚Äúto take steps in matters of international concern for the prevention and control of diseases‚Äù.</li>
              <li>United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency (UNRRA) established in US in 1943 with the purpose of organizing recovery from the effects of second world war, especially in combating epidemics, assisting nations to build up their health services, and implementing International sanitary convention.</li>
              <li>World Health Organization (WHO) which came into being on April 7, 1948, following ratification of its constitution by 26 member states after an international conference in New York in 1946.</li>
              <li> In 1951 the WHO adopted the international sanitary regulations. </li>
              <li>The regulations adopted in 1951 focused on six (6) communicable diseases that required coordinated international efforts to control their transmission between countries ‚Äì Yellow fever, Plague, Cholera, Smallpox, Louse-borne relapsing fever and Louse-borne Typhus. (The ISR was later changed in 1969 to IHR) The aim of the regulation was to prevent and protect against the international spread of diseases with minimum interference with world travel and trade. </li>
              <li>The regulation was further amended in 1973 and 1981 and the six diseases were reduced to three, namely: Yellow fever, Plague and Cholera; and revised again in 2005 to include all public health conditions and events of international concern (PHEIC).</li>

            <div class='body'>
               <ul>
                <li>The international health regulation (IHR) was first adopted by the WHO in 1969 to replace the international sanitary regulations that was in force since 1951. </li>
                <li>They are a set of legally binding international agreement that govern the roles of the WHO and all (194) of its Member states in identifying, sharing information about, and responding to public health events that may have international consequences.</li>
                <li> The IHRs are intended to ensure maximum security against the international spread of diseases with minimum interference of world traffic.</li>
                <li>There were first introduced to help monitor and control serious diseases (cholera, yellow fever, plague, smallpox, louse-borne relapsing fever and louse-borne typhus) which had serious potential to spread between countries.</li>
                <li> The international health regulations were further amended between 1973 and 1981 and the six diseases were reduced to only four and subsequently to three: yellow fever, plague and cholera (as smallpox had been eradicated in 1980).</li>
                <li> As trade and international travels increased significantly since its first adoption it became rather necessary to broaden the scope of the IHR.</li>
                <li>The IHR was revised recently in 2005. The scope of the revised IHR 2005 has been expanded to include any disease or event that presents, or could present significant harm to humans. The revised IHR 2005 introduced the concept of ‚Äúpublic health emergency of international concern‚Äù (PHEIC), whereby any event that affects the public health of more than one WHO member state may qualify as a PHEIC. </li>
                <li>This would include, for example, the chemical discharge of a hazardous agent, the contamination of food crossing borders, etc., as well as some infectious diseases. The revised IHR 2005 therefore broadened the scope, and the IHR is no longer limited to the notification of specific diseases, but cover all other hazards or events that constitute public health emergencies of international concern</li>
               </ul>

               <h4><span class="special-text-4">International Notification of Diseases</span></h4>
               <p>  For diseases notification, the IHR aimed to reflect more on communicable diseases, including the emerging and re-emerging diseases. Previously, notification was limited only to three main diseases, namely: cholera, yellow fever and plague. </p>
               <p>The revised International Health Regulations, 2005 broadened the scope to include three main categories of events that require to be notified under the IHR as follows:</p>
               <ol type="a">
                <li>Four conditions that must be notified to the WHO, namely: </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Small  pox, </li>
                  <li>Poliomyelitis due to wild type poliovirus ,</li>
                  <li>Human influenza caused by the new subtype, and </li>
                  <li>SAARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Other diseases or events may require notification if they are considered to be events of potential international public health concern namely cholera, plague, Yellow fever, VHF (Lassa , Ebola, Marburg virus disease) and other diseases that are of special national or regional concern, e.g. dengue fever</li>
                <li>Any event of potential international public health concern including those of unknown cause or source, and those involving other events or diseases than those listed in a) and b) above.</li>
