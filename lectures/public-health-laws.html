               <p>Health law refers to a statute (decree, act, bill, order, and ruling edits), ordinance or code that prescribes sanitary standards and regulations for the purpose of promoting and preserving the community's health. (Black's Law Dictionary, 8th ed. 2004) </p>
               <p>PHL is concerned with the legal powers and duties of the government to assure the conditions for people to be healthy (e.g., to identify, prevent, and ameliorate risks to health in the population) and the limitations on the power of the government to constrain the autonomy, confidentiality, privacy, or other legally protected interests of individuals for the protection or promotion of community health.

                <li>By Section 1 of the Compulsory Treatment and Care for Victims of Gunshot Act 2017, all hospitals in Nigeria shall accept and treat without a police clearance any person with a gunshot wound. Section 2 further mandates all security agencies to render the necessary assistance to gunshot victims and ensure that they are taken promptly to a hospital for treatment. </li>
                <li>Furthermore, in the said Section, the law provides that all victims with gunshot wounds shall be treated without a request for initial monetary deposits and such persons shall not be victims of any inhuman or degrading treatment.</li>
                <li>A hospital that receives any person with a gunshot wound is also enjoined to make a report to the nearest police station within 2 hours of treatment, failure to do this attracts a fine of N100,000 and every doctor concerned with the treatment, is liable on conviction to a fine of N100,000 or 6 months imprisonment or both.</li>
                <li>Any person, police officer or security agent who stands by and fails to give the necessary help to a victim of gunshot wound, which leads to the unnecessary death of the Victim, commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine of N500,000 or 5 years imprisonment or both.</li>
                <li>Also any person who commits an offence which causes substantial damage of whatever form to the victim, is liable on conviction to 15 years imprisonment without the option of fine.</li>
                <li>In addition to all these penalties, the court can also order that a person or corporate body in default, pays to the victim, an amount equivalent to the loss sustained by the victim. This is known as restitution.</li>
                <li>Please share across all platforms so security agents and medical practitioners are informed of this law, in order to ensure the preservation of the lives of victims with gunshot wounds.</li>
