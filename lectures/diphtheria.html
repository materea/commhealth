                <li> Attempts to remove the membrane may result in bleeding. </li>
                <li> A minimal area of mucosal erythema surrounds the membrane.</li>

                <li>Laryngeotracheal diphtheria is most often preceded by pharygotonsillar disease, usually is associated with fever, hoarseness and croupy cough at presentation.</li>

                <li>Initially it may be clinically indistinguishable from viral croup or epiglottitis.</li>
                <li>Prostration and dyspnoea soon follow because of the obstruction caused by the membrane. </li>
                <li>This obstruction may even cause suffocation if not promptly relieved by intubation or tracheostomy.</li>

            <p>The diphtheria bacilli within the membrane continue to produce toxin actively.</p>

                <li>Fatty infiltration, and </li>

            </ul>
            <p> Irregularities of the cardiac rhythm indicate damage to the heart. </p>
            <p> Later there may be difficulties with vision, speech, swallowing, or movement of the arms or legs.</p>
            <p>The toxin also produces nerve damage, resulting in paralysis of the soft palate, eye muscles or extremities. </p>
            <p>Patients who survive complications recover completely.</p>
            <p>Nasal diphtheria, the mildest form of respiratory diphtheria, usually is localized to the septum or turbinates of one side of the nose. </p>
            <p> Occasionally membrane extend into pharynx.</p>
            <p> Nonrespiratory mucosal surface i.e., the conjunctivae and genitals may also be sites of infection. </p>

            <li> For mild early pharyngeal of laryngeal disease the dose is 20,000-40,000 units. </li>
            <li> For moderate nasopharyngeal disease, 40,000-60,000 units is administered.</li>
            <li> For severe, extensive or late (3 days or more) disease, 80,000- 100,000 units. </li>
            <li> In addition to anti toxin every case should be treated with penicillin or erythromycin for 5 to 6 days to clear the throat of C. diphtheriae (this decreases toxin production)</li>

                <li> Contacts merits special attention. They should be throat swabbed and their immunity status determined.</li>
                <li> Non immunized close contact should receive prophylactic penicillin or erythromycin.  (1000-2000 units of diphtheria antitoxin can actively immunize against diphtheria).</li>

            <h4><span class="special-text-4">DPT vaccine </span></h4>
            <ul>
                <li> It is a combined vaccine. </li>
                <li> The preparation of choice is DPT, because it can be immunized simultaneously against three diseases, viz., Diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus.</li>
                <li> There are two types of vaccine:  plain and adsorbed. </li>
                <li> Adsorption is usually out on a mineral carrier like aluminium phosphate or hydroxide.</li>
                <li> Adsorption increases immunological effectiveness of the vaccine. </li>
                <li> WHO recommends the use of adsorbed vaccines.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><span class="special-text-4">DPT storage </span></h4>
            <ul>
                <li> DPT/DT vaccine should not be frozen. </li>
                <li> They should be stored in a refrigerator between 2 to 8 degree Celsius.</li>
                <li> The vaccine should be used before the date of expiry indicated on the vial. </li>
                <li> The vaccine will lose its potency if it is kept in room temperature over a long period of time</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><span class="special-text-4">Optimum age </span></h4>
            <ul>
                <li> Young infants respond well to immunization with potent vaccines and toxoids, even in the presence of low to moderate levels of maternal antibodies.</li>
                <li> The Expanded programme of Immunization has recommended that DPT vaccine can be safely and effectively administered as early as 6 weeks after birth.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><span class="special-text-4">Number of doses </span></h4>
            <ul>
                <li> Three doses of DPT each of which is usually 0.5ml, should be considered optimal for primary immunization.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><span class="special-text-4">Interval between doses </span></h4>
            <ul>
                <li> The current recommendation is to allow an interval of 4 weeks between 3 doses, with a booster injection at one and a half years or two years, followed by another booster (DT only) at the age of 5 to 6 years.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><span class="special-text-4">Mode of administration </span></h4>
            <ul>
                <li> All vaccines containing mineral carriers or adjuvants should be injected deep intramuscular. </li>
                <li> This applies to DPT also.</li>
                <li> DPT is given in the upper and outer quadrant of the gluteal region. </li>
                <li> For children under one year of age, DPT should be administered in (lateral aspect) of the thigh.  (1984 Global Advisory Group).</li>
                <li> The most severe complications that could follow DPT immunization are encephalitis, encephalopathy, prolonged convulsions, infantile spasms and Reye’s syndrome.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><span class="special-text-4">Contraindications </span></h4>
            <ul>
                <li> Minor conditions such as cough, cold, mild fever are not contraindications. </li>
                <li> Seriously ill children are not vaccinated.</li>
                <li> DPT should not be repeated if a severe reaction occurred after a previous dose.</li>
                <li> Such reactions include collapse, shock like state, persistent screaming episodes, temperature above 40 degree Celsius, convulsions and other neurological symptoms.</li>
                <li> DT only is recommended in such case. (2 doses with 4 weeks apart with a booster dose 6 months to one year). </li>
                <li> Children who have received DPT earlier, should receive only DT as booster at 5-6 years or at school entry.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><span class="special-text-4">Antisera</span></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Diphtheria antitoxin prepared in horse serum is still the mainstay of passive prophylaxis and also for treatment of diphtheria.</li>
            </ul>
