            <blockquote>
                <p>‚ÄòEveryone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and wellbeing of himself and his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care.‚Äô</p>
                <p>‚Äî Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The idea that health is a human right was articulated in the United Nation‚Äôs Universal Declaration of Human Rights, created over 50 years ago at the inception of the organization.</p>
            <p>Read the quote. Notice how the wording reads, ‚Äústandard of living adequate for health‚Äù: as you read through this note, I want you to remember this phrase and ask yourself what kind of standard of living much of the world is experiencing?</p>

                <figcaption> How the right to health relates to other human rights </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>The Point of this Venn diagram is to demonstrate that the right to health is dependent upon the realization of other human rights, including economic and other sociopolitical rights! For example, one cannot protect themselves from sexually transmitted disease unless the right to education and information about their transmission is disseminated.  </p>
            <p>Thus in order to understand why the right to health in much of the world remains unfulfilled, we need to take a look at the economic and  social inequities which cause people to suffer from abysmal living conditions. </p>

              <ul>
                <li>According to the Human Development Report, 2003 published by the UNDP ‚ÄúMore than 1.2 billion persons survive on less than a dollar a day‚Äù which is the definition of extreme poverty.  That‚Äôs roughly 1 in 5 people on the earth!  </li>
                <li> The ‚Äúdollar a day‚Äù definition is based on purchasing power parity, meaning that it‚Äôs a dollar in U.S. terms.  For example, if a person from Cambodia came to the US right now, the wage they earn in Cambodia would translate into one dollar every day here in the United States. Just think of how much (or rather, how little) you can buy trying to survive on one dollar a day in today‚Äôs society?</li>
                <li>Notice that South Asia has the highest percentage of their population living on less than a dollar a day, with 43%; Sub-Saharan Africa comes in an unenviable close second with 24.3% of its population living on less than a dollar a day.</li>
                <li>Can you guess how much of the planet is trying to make it on less than $2 a day? Half the world, about 3 billion people live on less than 2 dollars a day.</li>
