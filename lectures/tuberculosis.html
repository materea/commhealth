            <p>In 2016, 10.4 million people fell ill with TB and 1.7million died from it(including 0.4 million among people with HIV)</p>
            <p>Over 95% of death occur in low and middle income countries.</p>
            <p>7 countries account for 64%of the total, with India leading the count, followed by Indonesia, China, Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria and S.A.</p>
            <p>In 2016, an estimated 1 million children became ill with TB and 250,000 children died of TB (including children with associated HIV)</p>
            <p>TB is the leading killer of HIV-positive people: in 2016, 40% of HIV death were due to TB</p>
            <p>MDR-TB remains a public health crisis and a health security threat</p>
            <p>WHO estimates that there were 600,000 new cases with resistance to rifampicin</p>

          <p>TB and HIV co-infection is when people have both HIV infection, and also either latent or active TB disease. </p>
          <p>When someone has both HIV and TB each disease speeds up the progress of the other. In addition to HIV infection speeding up the progression from latent to active TB, TB bacteria also accelerate the progress of HIV infection. </p>
          <p>If you have HIV infection you will not get infected with TB bacteria unless you are in contact with someone who also is infected with TB bacteria. </p>
          <p>Similarly if you have TB you will not get infected with HIV unless you carry out an activity, such as unsafe sex, with someone who already has HIV infection.</p>
          <p>TB also occurs earlier in the course of HIV infection than many other opportunistic infections. </p>
          <p>The risk of death in co-infected individuals is also twice that of HIV infected individuals without TB. This is even when antiretroviral (ARV) therapy is taken into account. </p>
          <p>When people have a damaged immune system, such as people with HIV who are not receiving antiretrovirals (ARVs), the natural history of TB is altered</p>
          <p>Instead of there being a long latency phase between infection and development of disease, people with HIV can become ill with active TB disease within weeks to months, rather than the normal years to decades.</p>
          <p>The risk of progressing from latent to active TB is estimated to be between 12 and 20 times greater in people living with HIV than among those without HIV infection</p>
          <p>This also means that they may become infectious and pass TB on to someone else, more quickly than would otherwise happen. </p>
          <p>The lifetime risk for HIV negative people of progressing from latent to active TB is about 5-10%</p>

               <p>The Genexpert test is a molecular test for TB which diagnoses TB by detecting the presence of TB bacteria, as well as testing for resistance to the drug Rifampicin.</p>
               <p>Some organizations have claimed that the Genexpert test is going to revolutionize the diagnosis and care of people with TB</p>
               <p>The test is a molecular test which detects the DNA in TB bacteria. It uses a sputum sample and can give a result in less than 2 hours. It can also detect the genetic mutations associated with resistance to the drug Rifampicin</p>
               <p>WHO recommends that the test should be used as the initial diagnosis test in individuals suspected of having MDR TB, or HIV associated TB </p>
               <p>WHO also suggested that it could be used as a follow on test to microscopy in settings where MDR TB and/or HIV is of lesser concern, especially in smear negative specimens, because of the lack of accuracy of smear microscopy.</p>
               <p>WHO also emphasized that the test does not eliminate the need for conventional microscopy culture and drug sensitivity testing, as these are still required to monitor treatment progress and to detect other types of drug resistance</p>
               <p>The Genexpert MTB/RIF cannot be used for treatment monitoring, as it detects both live and dead bacteria</p>

                    <p>WHO had been particularly keen on the use of the test and in 2010 said that:</p>
                    <p>‚ÄúThis new test represents a major milestone for global TB diagnosis and care. It also represents new hope for the millions of people who are at the highest risk of TB and drug resistant disease.‚Äù</p>
                    <p>The main advantages of the test are, for diagnosis, reliability when compared to sputum microscopy and the speed of getting the result when compared with the culture test.</p>
                    <p>For diagnosis of TB, although sputum microscopy is both quick and cheap, it is often unreliable. It is particularly unreliable when people are HIV positive.</p>
                    <p>Although culture gives a definitive diagnosis, to get the result usually takes weeks rather than the hours of the Genexpert test.</p>
                    <p>The main advantage in respect of identifying rifampicin resistance, is again the matter of speed. Normally to get any drug resistance result takes weeks rather than hours.</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>This vaccine contains live attenuated tubercle bacilli of the bovine strain. </li>
                      <li>It may be administered intradermally by syringe and needle or by the multiple-puncture technique.</li>
                      <li>It confers significant but not absolute immunity; in particular, it protects against the disseminated miliary lesions of tuberculosis and tuberculous meningitis.</li>

                    <p><b><i>Immunization strategy</i></b></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>BCG vaccination may be used selectively in tuberculin-negative persons who are at high risk, for example close contacts, doctors, nurses and hospital ward attendants.</li>
                      <li>A strain of BCG that is resistant to isoniazid has been developed; this can be used in vaccinating tuberculosis contacts who require immediate protection with isoniazid.</li>
                      <li>BCG may also be used more widely in immunizing tuberculin-negative persons, especially children, in the community</li>
                      <li>In some developing countries where preliminary tuberculin testing may significantly reduce coverage, BCG may be administered in mass campaigns without tuberculin tests</li>
                      <li>The disadvantage of this method of ‚Äòdirect BCG vaccination‚Äô is that those who are tuberculin-positive are likely to show more severe local reactions at the site of vaccination.</li>
                      <li>BCG vaccination of the new-born is widely practiced in the tropics.</li>
                      <li>Overall, the evidence suggests that it confers considerable protection against tuberculosis in infants and young children.</li>
                      <li>The strategy introduced recently in Expanded Immunization Programmes, is to give BCG vaccination a few months after birth. The implications of this different timing have yet to be assessed</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><b><i>Disadvantages</i></b></p>
                    <p>Various complications have been encountered in the use of BCG. These may be:</p>

                    </ul>

                    <p>WHO recommends the short course directly observed therapy (DOTS).</p>
                    <p>This consists of 2 months of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazanimide and ethambutol given daily, followed by 4 months of isoniazid and rifampicin given thrice weekly</p>
                    <p>As part of the DOTS strategy, health workers counsel and observe their patients swallowing each dose, and the health service monitors the patients‚Äô progress until each is cured</p>
                    <p>Political and financial commitments and a dependable drug supply are essential parts of the DOTS strategy</p>
                    <p>Despite the fact that DOTS is very cost-effective ($20 for 6 months of medicines), not all endemic countries have adopted it yet</p>
                    <p>In terms of disability adjusted life years (DALYs), treatment of smear positive cases of TB with DOTS works out at $3 per DALY saved ‚Äì a very effective intervention. </p>
                    <p>The DOTS strategy is being reviewed and may be modified in the future.</p>
                    <p>An urgent need for new effective anti-tuberculous drugs exists</p>

           <p>55% of the 83,263 new cases detected were smear positive (46,026). </p>
           <p>The TB burden is further compounded by the high HIV prevalence of 4.4% in the country.  The recorded HIV  prevalence  among  TB  patients  increased  from  2.2%  in  1991  to  about  27%  in  2008</p>
