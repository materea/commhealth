           <ol>
            <li>Air and noise pollution</li>
            <ul>
                <li>When there are no adequate windows and doors in a house, it interferes with the normal air exchanging in a dwelling resulting to pollution. </li>
                <li>Also, houses that are constructed and located near factories, airports, roads or land prone to flooding are exposed to noise pollution and this may result to deafness, conjunctivitis, lungs cancer, hearing loss etc. </li>
                <li>All these occur as a result of receiving and inhaling dangerous fumes released from automobile and other chemical equipment used in such establishments.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>High prevalence of diseases</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Poor housing design triggers the occurrence and spread of diseases e.g. poor surface drainage in the house with stagnant pools encourage the breeding of mosquitoes and other disease carrying vectors which attack and transmit diseases to humans in their cause of feeding. </li>
                <li>Overcrowding and ill-ventilation also serves as a route in the transmission of respiratory or infectious disease such as tuberculosis, asthma, influenza, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Accident</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Most injuries and poisoning in a house is as a result of poor condition of the home, such as presence of dilapidated walls, cracked walls, broken floor etc. which result in vehicular accident, drowning, falls, accidental burning. </li>
                <li>These effects can also occur as a result of lack of different activities e.g. sitting-rooms, dining rooms, toilet, bathroom, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Excessive heat and cold</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Poor housing design causes exposure to excessive heat during the day and cold in the night. </li>
                <li>This is as a result of absence of ceiling or sagging ceiling and absence of DPC in the house as a result of stress, the occupier exercise during the night, his social activities are been disrupted in attention to make up for the loss sleep.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Homelessness and insecurity</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The use of non-durable material in houses has resulted to many structural failures which expose the occupier to inclement weather and lack of security. </li>
                <li>The risk of violent attacks are high in poor houses compared to well-built environment not only directly impacts our health, but also factor in less direct complex ways into the health of individuals residing in single family homes, housing projects, blocks, neighbourhoods and entire cities and communities. </li>
                <li>Homelessness causes depression when it occurs, the individual capability towards performing his social activities are reduced to residential environment, but can also found in commercial environments as far as housing is concerned</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Poor educational attainment and deprivation</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The poor design and the materials used for constructing a house (school) often can render the environment unconducive for learning especially during extreme weather condition. </li>
                <li>These factors have serious health implications with attendant social and economic consequences including school absenteeism. </li>
                <li>Most children in poor house are more likely to underachieve in school compared with those from organised and improved areas.</li>
