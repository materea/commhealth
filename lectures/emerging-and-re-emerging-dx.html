                <li>Emerging diseases represent infections that have recently appeared among humans or that are rapidly spreading among humans in terms of incidence or geographical distribution</li>
                <li>They are recognized as pathogens whose incidence have increased within the past two decades or threaten to increase in the near future</li>
                <li>During the last 40 years, at least 50 emerging infectious agents have been identified with approximately 10% of them being bacterial agents</li>
                <li>The term â€˜emerging diseaseâ€™ has a fairly broad definition and in general, encompasses any one of three disease situations:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>a known agent appearing in a new geographic area </li>
                    <li>a known agent or its close relative occurring in a hitherto unsusceptible species</li>
                    <li>a previously unknown agent detected for the first time</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Re-emerging disease is the reappearance of a known infection after a decline in incidence</li>
                <li>They describe infectious agents that have been known for some time, had fallen to such low levels that they were no longer considered public health problems and are now showing upward trend in incidence or prevalence worldwide</li>
                <li>In December 2015, a group of experts met in Geneva to assess emerging global disease and to group them into categories</li>
                <li>The Most Dangerous diseases were </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ebola Virus Disease (EVD)</li>

                    <li>Lassa fever</li>
                    <li>Rift Valley Fever (RVF) and </li>
                    <li>Crimean Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>The second category ranked as Serious Diseases includes </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chikungunya (CHIK)</li>
                    <li>Severe Fever with Thrombocytopaenia Syndrome (SFTS) and </li>
                    <li>Zika virus</li>
                </ul>
                <li>The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Tuberculosis, Malaria, Avian influenza and Dengue, though considered important, were not ranked because they have already received much attention and funding</li>
                <li>And most recently, Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19), emerged in late 2019 </li>
                <li>Fifty percent of known human pathogens and nearly 75% of all emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic in origin, many of which spilled over from natural wildlife reservoirs into human populations, either directly or through contact with domestic animals</li>

Barely four years later, the country witnessed a re-emergence of the same epidemic- prone disease with 430 suspected cases and 40 deaths in 14 states in 2015. All these episodes also had nosocomial transmissions</li>

                    <li>Nigeriaâ€™s population size in addition to it behavioural, nutritional and hygiene practices, cultural beliefs, poor environmental practices and massive inter/intra centre movement are the drivers of the disease transmission </li>

                    <li>The first case in Nigeria was a Liberian-American, who flew from Liberia to the city of Lagos on 20 July 2014. </li>

                    <li>Another outbreak was reported on 14 September 2017 when a 7 year old girl developed symptoms and as of 19 December 341 suspected cases and 45 probable and 9 confirmed deaths had been reported in 16 states of the federation inluding Kwara State</li>
                    <li>The most recent outbreak was in Edo state in Sep 2018, from 22 Sep to 31 Dec 2018 a total of 146 suspected cases, 42 presumptive positive and 32 confirmed cases with 26 deaths across 15 of 18 LGAs in Edo State.</li>
                    <li>The outbreak was attributed to vector-borne transmission and low vaccine coverage, hence WHO recommends vaccination and vector control for the prevention and control</li>
